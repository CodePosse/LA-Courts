            mental health and housing services, via a voluntary CARE Agreement or CARE Plan established and overseen by

                <p> Upon acceptance of the petition, the individual is assigned an attorney who will represent them

                  of Mental Health (LACDMH) to assist in identifying the participant's needs and assist in the
                  development of a CARE Agreement or Care Plan, if appropriate. </p>
